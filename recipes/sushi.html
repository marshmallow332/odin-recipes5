<p class="sushi-text">Homemade Sushi is so much cheaper than at the restaurant. Plus, it's easy and fun to make your own rolls at home, so you can put all your favorite ingredients into your perfect custom roll — here's how!</p>
<p>I'll be very honest and say that there's definitely a reason why sushi chefs spend a decade learning how to perfect sushi rice or cut raw fish like a boss, because it does make a difference.</p>
<p>Homemade sushi will never be at the level of what you'd get from the top sushi restaurants in NYC, but here's where homemade sushi rolls win:</p>
<p>You get to gorge yourself on a FEAST for like $20, whereas a similar amount of food at a restaurant would cost a couple hundred. Soooooo worth it, if you ask me.</p>
<p>And you know what else? Sushi is really fun to make at home.</p>
<p>We are fortunate to have access to sushi-grade fish (our favorite is raw salmon), but you can still make sushi at home if you can't find some.</p>
<p>Shrimp tempura rolls are one of our favorites, or you could do a California roll using real or imitation crab, or you could even try a veggie roll. One of our regulars is Philadelphia rolls, with smoked salmon, cream cheese, avocado, and cucumber.</p>
<p>All of these sushi rolls are sometimes referred to as “maki rolls,” which is any type of roll where ingredients like raw fish and vegetables are rolled with vinegar-seasoned rice and nori. The sky is the limit when it comes to filling ingredients, and the best part is getting creative with your own rolls.</p>
<p>Or if you want to try something a little different, you can make Korean Kim Bap. It's fairly similar to sushi, but no raw fish.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul class="sushi-textt">
    <li>seaweed for sushi</li>
    <li>rice</li>
    <li>salmon</li>
    <li>avocado</li>
    <li>cream cheese</li>
    <li>soy sauce</li>
    <li>pickled ginger</li>
    <li>wasabi paste</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol class="sushi-textt">
    <li>Spread your sheet of nori with a layer of prepared sushi rice, and flatten the top of the rice gently with a paddle, but do not smash the rice. And make sure not to neglect the edges of the nori sheet!</li>
    <li>Cut your salmon fish straight down through the filet, then cut that piece in half through the center so you have a small strip. Make sure you're using a sharp knife and gliding with one stroke, to get a nice clean cut.</li>
    <li>Place your desired ingredients onto the sushi rice. I've got salmon, avocado, and cream cheese </li>
    <li>Roll it up tightly, using a bamboo mat. It's a specific kitchen item, but you can get a decent one for less than $2 on Amazon or at an Asian market, so I think it's worth having. It ensures the best results for the roll holding together.</li>
    <li>Then use your sharpest knife to cut the sushi salmon roll into pieces. I don't find it particularly better to use a serrated knife. Just make sure to use a sharp one!</li>
    <li>You may also wish to have a small bowl of cold water or a damp towel at your work station for wiping your fingertips between rolls. Sometimes things can get sticky, so this can really make things easier!</li>
    <li>Now you're ready to eat the sushi rolls with some soy sauce, pickled ginger, and wasabi paste, as desired!</li>
